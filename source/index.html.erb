      <p class="lead"> <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %> and a growing group of collaborators have gained substantial experience developing a   standard language oncology data: the <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %> FHIR Implementation Guide. MITRE launched the <%=link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator", "https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> to build a Community that continues to gain substantial experience around deploying and demonstrating the value of mCODE for solving challenges faced by cancer patients, providers, researchers, payers, and others stakeholders. If the successes of mCODE and CodeX are unfamiliar, please review the <%= link_to("mCODE and CodeX Case Study","/casestudies/mcode_codex.html") %>. </p>

<p class="lead">MITRE's perspective and experience in launching CodeX, mCODE, and similar initiatives are shared in this Health Data Interoperabilty Playbook ("the Playbook"). Two new specialties - cardiology and genomics - are already applying the CodeX / mCODE experience to improve data interoperability in. If all specialties could follow the same approach in a collaborative way, this would help ensure that the sum of standards created across multiple specialties enables every person to have a coherent, lifetime Standard Health Record that improves care and research for all.</p>

<p class="lead">The Playbook is organized around five tracks that form a framework for the CodeX / mCODE approach: <%= link_to("Community Building", "/playbook/community.html") %>, <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "/playbook/use_cases_planning.html") %>, <%= link_to("Standards Development", "/playbook/standards.html") %>, <%= link_to("Implementation & Testing", "/playbook/implementation.html") %>, and <%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "/playbook/adoption.html") %>. These tracks have proven to facilitate efficient and impactful work. A high-level overview of the five tracks can be found in the <%= link_to("Introduction", "/playbook/index.html#organization") %>, with more details on each track via the links above and the Playbook Menu site navigation.</p>
<p class="lead">Also provided are <%= link_to("Case Studies", "/casestudies/index.html") %> that illustrate how specific projects have leveraged the tracks. Case Studies include the history of activities, outcomes of the work, and lessons learned that may be useful for new specialties. Additional details realted to the tracks and Case Studies can be found in the <%= link_to("Resources", "/resources/index.html") %> section.</p>
