      <p class="lead">The <%=link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator", "https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> Community has gained substantial experience in a developing global data standard for cancer care – the <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>. CodeX has also gained experience deploying and demonstrating the value of mCODE for solving specific problems faced by cancer patients and others stakeholders. Extending this experience to Cardiology and Genomics is underway.</p>
<p class="lead">MITRE's perspective and experience in launching CodeX, mCODE and other similar initiativs are shared in this Playbook to help other specialties leverage what’s been learned. If specialties could follow the CodeX approach in a collaborative way, this would help ensure that the sum of standards created across multiple specialties enables every person to have a coherent, lifetime Standard Health Record that improves health care and research for all.</p>

<p class="lead">The core of this site is organized around five related work tracks that comprise the CodeX / mCODE approach - <%= link_to("Community Building", "community.html") %>, <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "use_cases_planning.html") %>, <%= link_to("Standards Development", "standards.html") %>, <%= link_to("Implementation & Testing", "implementation.html") %>, and <%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "adoption.html") %> - and which have proven to be an effective framework for and facilitator of CodeX work.  Also provided are <%= link_to("Case Studies", "/casestudies/index.html") %> based on the above tracks, including the history of activities, outcomes, and implications that may be useful for new specialties. Details realted to the tracks and Case Studies can be found in the <%= link_to("Resources", "/resources/index.html") %> section.</p>
