      <p class="lead"> In 2017, leaders within <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %> and the <%= link_to("American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)","https://www.asco.org/") %> recognized a fundamental challenge in oncology: lack of a single standard for collecting and sharing data electronically. This lack of standardization led to numerous issues, including difficulties in sharing or quickly analyzing data and an increased risk of miscommunicating critical treatment information.</p>

<p class="lead">To address these issues, MITRE and ASCO partnered with additional experts to develop <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>: a FHIR-based standard for oncology data capture and sharing. MITRE also worked with Health Level Seven (HL7) to launch the <%=link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator", "https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %>, an expanding Community of providers, researchers, payers, vendors, and other stakeholders demonstrating the value and driving adoption of mCODE to address a range of real world challenges.</p>

<p class="lead">This Health Data Interoperability Playbook ("the Playbook") summarizes MITRE's experience leading mCODE and CodeX, with the intent of helping <%= link_to("Champions", "/playbook/community.html#champions") %> and their teams from additional specialties guide their Communities through the development of data standard that improve health care and research. The Playbook is organized around five tracks that form a framework for the CodeX / mCODE approach: <%= link_to("Community Building", "/playbook/community.html") %>, <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "/playbook/use_cases_planning.html") %>, <%= link_to("Standards Development", "/playbook/standards.html") %>, <%= link_to("Implementation & Testing", "/playbook/implementation.html") %>, and <%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "/playbook/adoption.html") %>. A high-level overview of the five tracks can be found in the <%= link_to("Introduction", "/playbook/index.html#organization") %>, with more details on each track via the links above and the Playbook Menu site navigation.</p>
      
<p class="lead">Also provided are <%= link_to("Case Studies", "/casestudies/index.html") %> that illustrate how specific projects have leveraged the tracks. Case Studies include the history of activities, outcomes of the work, and lessons learned that may be useful for new specialties. Additional details realted to the tracks and Case Studies can be found in the <%= link_to("Resources", "/resources/index.html") %> section.</p>
