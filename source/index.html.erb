    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Today, a patient’s health story is nearly impossible to collect and share because data are unreliable, stored in different locations, lack standardization, and are largely unusable. </p>
      <p>The <%= link_to("CodeX HL7 Accelerator","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> is a member-driven
        community, launched by MITRE in 2019, that is working together to break down silos endemic to our current system
        for specialty health data. The initial projects within CodeX
        solve problems in the cancer domain, building and leveraging the
        <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %> standard. The
        growing CodeX community is now also addressing problems in the
        cardiovascular disease and genomics domains.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Circumstances across the
        health landscape are converging to make this time in history, finally, the right time
        for all medical specialties to standardize health data and deploy
        standards-based solutions to their most challenges problems. It’s hoped that MITRE's experience in CodeX
        and elsewhere, as shared on this site, will speed the work of other
        specialties. It’s also hoped that aligning future specialty standards development with the CodeX
        approach will help ensure that new efforts are implemented
        consistently to give every person a coherent, cross-specialty,
        lifetime Standard Health Record that improves care and research for all.
