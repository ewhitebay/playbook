        <h2>Questions to Consider Before Launching a Substantial, New Specialty Initiative</h2>

    
    <p>When people from outside the oncology space learn about how the mCODE Standard and CodeX Community are revolutionizing interoperability for cancer data (see the <%= link_to("mCODE and CodeX Case Study","/casestudies/mcode_codex.html") %>), they often ask, "How can I relicate this experience to improve interoperability within our specialty?".</p>
<p>
The rest of this site shares experience aimed to help a new specialty standards initiative get from its start to delievering real value.  However, MITRE has found that the following are the <b>most important initial questions that should be asked and largely answered well before starting a substantial data standards, implementation, and deployment initiative within a new specialty</b>. These questions purposely do not have a one-to-one corresponse with the tracks covered in subsequent sections of the Playbook.  More details on each question can be found in other parts of the Playbook and Case Studies.</p>
    <ul class="action-list">
<br>    
     <li><b>Which specialty Community Champions will drive success?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Champions are the most important key to the steps below and elsewhere in the Playbook.</li> 
          <li>Champions understand needs, reach large constituencies, and mobilize resources.</li>
          <li>Leading medical professional societies and Government organizations have been the successful CodeX Champions.</li>
          <li>Must commit to the approach, to leading a project that grows in complexity and participation, and to helping to find skills and funding.</li>
<li>(Key Playbook Track: <%= link_to("Community Building", "community.html") %>)</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
<br>            
      <li><b>Do Champions and other leading organizations agree on a Governance framework?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Good Governance facilitates communications, decision making, project management, and resource distribution.</li>
          <li>Must be lightweight, with focus on providing infrastructure, starting use cases, adjudicating concerns, and applying funding to projects (sparingly).</li>
          <li>The CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator serves this purpose for Use Cases around cancer (mCODE standard), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to startup and engage across specialties.</li>
<li>(Key Playbook Tracks: <%= link_to("Community Building", "community.html") %>, <%= link_to("Case Studies", "/casestudies/mcode_codex.html") %>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<br>            
      <li><b>Which Use Cases will the specialty work on first?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Cases help prioritize effort into manageable segments that attract key Champions and critical community members.</li>
          <li>Each Use Case includes a specific health IT or process challenge that (a) attracts more participants into the community, (b) defines, validates, and/or motivates improvements to underlying workflows and standards, and (c) motivates demand, adoption, and value. Data are collected and shared using the same standard for multiple use cases.</li>
          <li>Initial CodeX Use Cases often start with the easist (not typically easy) problems and solutions for which demonstrations can be delivered the soonest, around which many stakeholders can align. Use Cases can grow in scope over time.</li>
<li>(Key Playbook Track: <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "use_cases_planning.html") %>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<br>            
      <li><b>What's the plan for adoption of standards-based solutions?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Each Use Case needs a pragmatic approach that envisions how the resulting solution will be adopted in the ecosystem and improve care and/or reduce burden.</li>
          <li>Engagement of future users who require (e.g., gov’t agencies) and/or demand (e.g., customers) vendors to implement solutions has proved invaluable in CodeX.</li>
<li>(Key Playbook Tracks: <%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "use_cases_planning.html") %>, <%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "adoption.html") %>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<br>            
      <li><b>Are the necessary resources available to start the first Use Case(s) and deliver success?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting Use Cases and demonstrating solutions require specific types of organizations, skillsets, and often financing – at the right times.</li>
          <li>Resource requirements are typically less clear at the start but become clearer as work ramps up.</li>
          <li>Use Case scope and timelines can often be scaled to available resources and still be successful.</li>
          <li>In CodeX, initial, rapid, promising Use Case results - generally from the easiest early phases of a Use Case - helped attract and justify involvement of new organizations, gather the needed skillsets, and secured funding.</li>
