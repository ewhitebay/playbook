      <h1>Implementation & Testing</h1>
      <p class="lead">Health data standards must be implemented into software systems and workflows to provide a potentially-valuable new or enhanced function in the health ecosystem. Assessing the potential for real value requires testing, including pilots in increasingly realistic settings.</p>

<p>Both the implementation and testing can surface the need for updates to the Use Case (concept, workflow), standards, and/or software.
There are other significant biproducts of this Implementation & Testing track.  For example, it’s an opportunity to ensure the necessary Community members are actively involved within increasingly realistic environments. It’s an opportunity to attract new, critical organizations, based by demonstrating potential value, rather than just asserting potential value.
For Implementation & Testing to progress effectively, activities and necessary resources must be included thoughtfully in the Use Case plans, and prepared for as the Use Case initiative moves forward.</p>
<p>
The rest of this section covers experience gained in (a) Implementation, (b) Testing, and (c) Feedback into the previously-discussed Use Case & Planning and Standards Development tracks.

<h2 id="implement_workflows">Implement FHIR IG(s) into Systems and Workflows</h2>
<p>Every CodeX use case required implementing a FHIR data exchange to support new workflows. Communities unfamiliar with data exchange are encouraged to educate themselves and engage with outside interoperability experts to help guide implementation efforts. These experts include existing open-source software development communities and healthcare software vendors. These software development groups are key to ensuring the community is able to quickly implement use cases and adopt new, more efficient workflows. Many organizations lack sufficient resources to develop, implement and maintain software on their own and as a result rely on software vendor or open-source community support to translate FHIR implementation guides into functioning data exchange software.</p>
<p>Developing FHIR implementation guides and standards for data exchange is an iterative process cycling between software testing and refining the implementation guide. To ensure that the final result is widely adoptable the following question should be addressed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is the IG understandable based on technical specifications and documentation?</li>
	<li>Is the IG implementable?</li>
	<li>Are the systems implementing the IG able to communicate with other systems?</li>
	<li>Are the use case and IG workflows realistic workflows from the developer and clinician perspectives?</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, it’s critical to receive specific comments and recommendations for change that can be taken back to the FHIR IG and the Use Case and Planning teams so that adjustments can be considered - adjustments that could be very helpful before testing becomes intense.</p>

<h2 id="execute_pilots">Test and Pilot</h2>
<p>Testing and pilots within CodeX Use Cases tend to start simply and then ramp up to as realistic a scenario as possible, via multiple phases. Testing of the implemented IG should start as early as possible, even if on a subset of the future functionality. </p>
<p>The following table is a simplified set of testing axes that aim for a higher degree realistic challenges from the top of the table to the bottom.  A particular test or pilot might combine components from different rows, and not just across a single row. </p>

<%= partial "partials/example_options" %>

<p>Early testing provides early feedback and engages key Community members in activities that bring the Use Case concept and IG closer to life. </p>
<p>However, the CodeX Use Cases have found it useful to start with very simple tests that can be started in 6-12 months after start of the project, including components similar to the first row in the table above. Over time, CodeX Use Cases typically ramp up through increasingly ambitious tests to real-world pilots including components similar to the bottom row:  e.g., demonstrating the full Use Case workflow, using software systems intended for sale or otherwise deployed, using real patient data, driven by the intended users, and within many organizations across which the future Use Case is planned to operate. See the <%= link_to("Radiation Therapy Treatment Data Case Study","https://codex-hl7-fhir-accelerator.github.io/playbook/casestudies/radiation_therapy.html") %> for a good example of planning and ramping up of testing.</p>
<p>
Obviously, real-world piloting requires substantial planning, commitment, preparation, and execution, well in advance of the execution of the pilot. This advanced planning is particularly important for testing in real healthcare settings, using real patient data, etc.
</p>

<p>For each of the tests and pilots, considerations typically include the elements below.  These elements should be nearly finalized when initial planning is complete, especially the commitment of the necessary resources.</p>

<ul class="action-list">
  <li>Objectives 
    <ul>
      <li>What improvements in health care and/or research does the Use Case aim to provide that will be assessed?  (e.g., What will be made better, faster, less expensive, more accessible, etc.?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Test Configuration
    <ul>
      <li>What parts of the Use Case workflow are being tested, and where are they being tested?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resources
    <ul>
      <li>Skill sets (e.g., project management, clinical, technical, logistics, legal, operational, etc.)</li>
    	<li>Software (e.g., EHRs, specialty systems, etc.)</li>
    	<li>Facilities (e.g., health system, labs, homes, registries, etc.)</li>
    	<li>Funding (e.g., for facilities, expertise, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Success
    <ul>
      <li>What metrics are available to assess current capabilities?</li>
      <li>What level of improvement will be measured during the test?</li>
      <li>How will success be measured?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for real-world implementations, technical experts should consider the following:</p>
<ul class="action-list">
  <li>How data is going to be stored and retrieved from local software systems.  
    <ul>
      <li>Ideally, data exchange standards and local data storage align, but often this is not the case. Translating between exchanged data into a local system architecture requires significant effort and can have severe consequences if done incorrectly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How software will be kept up-to-date.  
    <ul>
      <li>Software is not static; FHIR versions, software security standards, code sets, and IGs change over time and planning is necessary to ensure the community and individual implementors adapt to these changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scalability of workflows. 
    <ul>
      <li>Data exchange can bring many benefits, but also some hardware and staff challenges including:
		<ul>
		  <li>Increased network traffic. Data exchanges with high network traffic could slow or stop other critical data pipeline and the additional data processing could slow software response times.</li>
		  <li>Increased data storage needs. Usually the amount of data exchanged is very small and has minimal impact on overall system storage. However, because running out of data storage is so serious, often cause software crashes and system downtime, anytime additional system functionality is added hardware and software impacts should be assessed.</li>
		  <li>Increased worker burdens. While workflows may overall save staff time and effort, some staff may have increased workloads, especially technical support staff. For example, a common challenge is that patients with similar demographics will need a manual review to ensure the data files to the correct patient. Increased data exchange means staff verifying patient demographics matches have more responsibilities.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="use_feedback">Feedback to Update Previous Work, As Needed</h2>
<p>Even early phase pilots can provide salient feedback on the implementability of the IG in software, the usability of the updated systems, and the costs, human burden, and potential benefits of the new workflow.  Both implementation and testing can surface the need for updates to the Use Case (concept, workflow), standards, and/or software. A test or pilot may need to be repeated, once these updates are agreed and implemented.</p>
